Feature: React Native 0.72 Integration Tests

  Scenario: Build and Upload React Native 0.72 sourcemaps
    When I make the "features/base-fixtures/rn0_72/android"
    And I wait for the build to succeed

    When I run bugsnag-cli with upload react-native --upload-api-root-url=http://localhost:9339 --api-key=1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF --overwrite features/base-fixtures/rn0_72
    And I wait to receive 216 sourcemaps

    Then the sourcemap is valid for the React Native Build API
    Then the sourcemaps Content-Type header is valid multipart form-data
    And the sourcemap payload field "apiKey" equals "1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF"
    And the sourcemap payload field "appVersion" equals "1.0"
    And the sourcemap payload field "appVersionCode" equals "1"
    And the sourcemap payload field "platform" equals "android"
    And the sourcemap payload field "overwrite" equals "true"
    And I discard the oldest sourcemap

    Then the sourcemap is valid for the React Native Build API
    Then the sourcemaps Content-Type header is valid multipart form-data
    And the sourcemap payload field "apiKey" equals "1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF"
    And the sourcemap payload field "appVersion" equals "1.0"
    And the sourcemap payload field "appBundleVersion" equals "1"
    And the sourcemap payload field "platform" equals "ios"
    And the sourcemap payload field "overwrite" equals "true"
    And I discard the oldest sourcemap

    Then the sourcemap is valid for the Proguard Build API
    Then the sourcemaps Content-Type header is valid multipart form-data

    And the sourcemap payload field "appId" equals "com.rn0_72"
    And the sourcemap payload field "versionCode" equals "1"
    And the sourcemap payload field "versionName" equals "1.0"
    And the sourcemap payload field "overwrite" equals "true"
    And I discard the oldest sourcemap

    Then the sourcemap is valid for the dSYM Build API
    Then the sourcemaps Content-Type header is valid multipart form-data
    And the sourcemap payload field "apiKey" equals "1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF"
    And I discard the oldest sourcemap

    Then the sourcemap is valid for the NDK Build API
    Then the sourcemaps Content-Type header is valid multipart form-data
    And the sourcemap payload field "apiKey" equals "1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF"
    And the sourcemap payload field "appId" equals "com.rn0_72"
